## 📝 Technical Comparison & Use Case Report

### Overview

Different blockchains suit different environments. Here's a quick comparison of Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and R3 Corda based on their technical strengths, consensus mechanisms, and ideal use cases.

- **Ethereum** is a public blockchain supporting full decentralization. It uses Proof of Stake (PoS) and supports Solidity smart contracts, making it suitable for open, trustless DApps. However, its transaction speed (~15–30 TPS on Layer 1) is relatively low.
  
- **Hyperledger Fabric** is a private blockchain with a modular consensus model. It is highly performant (1000+ TPS), secure, and ideal for business networks like supply chains where data privacy and control are important. It does not support native tokens but supports smart contracts in languages like Go and JavaScript.
  
- **R3 Corda** is a consortium blockchain used primarily in regulated industries like banking. It supports confidential peer-to-peer transactions with notary-based consensus, focusing on privacy, reliability, and legal compliance.

### ✅ Best Platforms by Use Case

- **Decentralized Application (DApp):**  
  ✅ **Ethereum** — due to its public, open nature and robust smart contract support.

- **Supply Chain Among Known Partners:**  
  ✅ **Hyperledger Fabric** — due to its high throughput, permissioned access, and private channels.

- **Inter-bank Financial Applications:**  
  ✅ **R3 Corda** — because of its point-to-point privacy and finance-friendly architecture.
